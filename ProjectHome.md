WikiPlot is a plotting extension for MediaWiki, written completly in php. That will enable users to plot graphs from a mathematical expression, like x^2+4.

The project has been released, and we haven't planed much further development, but if you have any bugs, or feature request feel free to contact us. We're not completely closing development, and sometime in the future we might create a version 2.0...

### Status ###
The project is currently kind of dead, or lets just say not in active development. Main developers got other things to play with. But the code should be stable, feel free to submit patches, comments, bug reports, etc. any feedback is welcome.
