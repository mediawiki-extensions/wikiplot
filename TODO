Known bugs:
- Can't plot graphs like "tan(x)" correctly, this can be fixed 
  if we use a loop between MinX and MaxX instead of a loop between 0 and ImageWidth. 
  But this could very well have bad effects on performance.
- Can't plot functions with autogrid where the difference between 
  MaxX-MinX and MaxY-MinY is extrem, fix Get*GridSpace().
