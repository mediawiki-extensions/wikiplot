Known bugs:
- Can't plot graphs like "tan(x)" correctly, this can be fixed if we use a loop between MinX and MaxX instead of a loop between 0 and ImageWidth. But this could very well have bad effects on performance.
- Can't plot functions with autogrid where the difference between MaxX-MinX and MaxY-MinY i extrem, fix Get*GridSpace().

TODO:
- plot.class.php Test a loop between MinX and MaxX instead of 0 and ImageWidth (See known bugs).
- plot.class.php Create constructor
- plot.class.php Documentate classes with phpdocu
- WikiPlot.php	 Implementation of WikiML specification
