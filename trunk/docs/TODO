Known bugs:
- Can't plot "tan(x)" correctly, this can be fixed if we use a loop between MinX and MaxX instead of a loop between 0 and ImageWidth. But this could very well have bad effects on performance.

TODO:
- plot.class.php Fix lacking entries in GetHash() (See TODO's in source).
- plot.class.php Test a loop between MinX and MaxX instead of 0 and ImageWidth (See known bugs).
- plot.class.php Create constructor
- plot.class.php Documentat classes with phpdocu
- plot.class.php Add version/revision number to GetHash()
- plot.class.php Implementat ShortNumber()
