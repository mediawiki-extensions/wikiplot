Known bugs:
- Can't plot graphs like "tan(x)" correctly, this can be fixed 
  if we use a loop between MinX and MaxX instead of a loop between 0 and ImageWidth. 
  But this could very well have bad effects on performance.
- Can't plot functions with autogrid where the difference between 
  MaxX-MinX and MaxY-MinY is extrem, fix Get*GridSpace().

TODO:
- plot.class.php Test a loop between MinX and MaxX instead of 0 and ImageWidth (See known bugs).
- plot.class.php Autogeneration of colors.
- plot.class.php Consider scaling image instead of generating new in Plot->GeneratePlot(), 
  when given ImageResource of wrong size.
- WikiPlot.php   Chech whether $argv are lower or uppercase perhaps mixed, and what to do about it!
- WikiPlot.php	 Cleanup source and write documentation
- 		 Generate tar.gz for installation and distribution
- Example.php	 Create example of how to use plot.class.php, and intergrate it with documentation.

Documentation:
- WikiPlot.php	 Documentate source code.
-		Write developers guide to plot.class.php
- ../		Write README, INSTALL, CHANGELOG, LICENSE and add to phpdoc
