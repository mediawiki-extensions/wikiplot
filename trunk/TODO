Known bugs:
- Can't plot graphs like "tan(x)" correctly, this can be fixed 
  if we use a loop between MinX and MaxX instead of a loop between 0 and ImageWidth. 
  But this could very well have bad effects on performance.
- Can't plot functions with autogrid where the difference between 
  MaxX-MinX and MaxY-MinY is extrem, fix Get*GridSpace().

TODO:

	TODO for 1.1
- plot.class.php Test a loop between MinX and MaxX instead of 0 and ImageWidth (See known bugs).
- plot.class.php Autogeneration of colors.
- WikiPlot.php	 Use width and height as x- and yspan if x-/yspan isn't provided.
- plot.class.php Consider scaling image instead of generating new in Plot->GeneratePlot(), 
  when given ImageResource of wrong size.

	TODO for 1.0 (show stoppers)
- WikiPlot.php   Chech whether $argv are lower or uppercase perhaps mixed, and what to do about it!
- ../		 Generate tar.gz for installation and distribution
- Example.php	 Create example of how to use plot.class.php, and intergrate it with documentation.
- We got to have a page-level DocBlock for evalmath.class.php and a DocBlock for EvalMath class and one for EvalMathStack class. (remember @package) 


Documentation:
-		Write developers guide to plot.class.php
-		Write a hackers guide to WikiPlot
- ../		Write README, INSTALL, CHANGELOG, LICENSE and add to phpdoc
